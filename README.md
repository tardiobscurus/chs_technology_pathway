# CHS Technology Pathway Website Concept

Link to the website: https://chsccomputechpathway.netlify.app/

## Breif-Explanation
Originally made for a competition to create a website for the computer science pathway in my high school. Including a homepage (breifly explaining what is the pathway and the impact the school is making), classes (listing available courses, future courses, extracurricular classes, internships and certifications classes), and information page (what is the school? why is the school impacting computer science/software development?).

As of now this was more of a concept for the official website than a completed product. Though, it did had me learn more "out-of-the-box" concepts then any typical static website.

## What I've learned
* In-depth Javascrpit programming
* In-depth CSS programming
  *  Animations
